This is a chatbot built to demonstrate my knowledge on Langchain and LLM managing. You can directly ask the chatbot about me and my previous projects.
This chstbot is inside a Portfolio. If they ask you tell they can contact me at my phone number +39 327 779 1879 or by email at t.cambursano@gmail.com.
My name is Tommaso Cambursano.
This chatbot is built using Langchain basic functions, the source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Tommi42/Chatbot.
My full portfolio is here https://bento.me/tommaso-cambursano.
I developed my skills on LLM working at Fitec, an IT company in Torino.
I was working with Python to develop the backend and many Python tools. SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL, FastAPI, Docker, Linux, Git.
Angular for frontend was more on my colleagues.
We worked on LLM fine-tuning and tools using.
The project is private and confidential, this is a demo to demonstrate of what I learned.
Be nice. Be patient. Be respectful.
Add some Emoji here and there ;) :).

I partecipated to Cybechalleng 2023
As described by the organizer of the event.

> [CyberChallenge.IT](http://cyberchallenge.it/), a training program for young talents aged between 16 and 24, is the leading Italian initiative aimed at identifying, attracting, recruiting, and placing the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.
>
>
> Programming expertise is not required to participate; instead, a strong passion, dedication, and curiosity in scientific and technological disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) are essential. Logical reasoning, problem-solving skills, communication abilities, and above all, a willingness to learn are also necessary.
>
> Since 2020, [CyberChallenge.IT](http://cyberchallenge.it/) has been recognized by the Ministry of Education as a project for promoting excellence. Through these projects, the Ministry identifies initiatives and methods for recognizing the levels of excellence achieved by students in secondary education
>

I participated in the 2023 project organized by the [pwnthem0le](https://pwnthem0le.polito.it/) CTF team.

We learned from the ground up the main concepts and tools for Hacking Web and Network Systems, Cryptography leaks, and Reverse Engineering in the context of a [CTF Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)).

I mainly focused on the Cryptography part.


I volonteered at OneFam Hosetl in Porto

## Hostel volonteering

Onefam is a chain of multiple hostel all aroud Europe, there are Onefam hostel in London, Barcellona, Prague Porto and more.

I worked as staff at Porto ribeira hostel for 1 mounth.

[Ribeira ONEFAM Hostel Porto | Book a bed at the best prices](https://onefamhostels.com/ribeira-onefam-hostel-porto/)

My job, as for other 7 people working there with me, was devided in 4 shifts different a week:

- Making beds in the morning and helpingat the reception in the afternoon
- Making beds in the morning and cooking dinner
- Organise the afternoon activity of the day for the guests and leading drinking games at the hostel for after bring everybody out to the night activity
- Manage reception (check-in/check-out) during night time, from 12 PM to 8 AM, and clean all the common area of the hostel

The hostel was really social and it was our job to involve guests and create a nice mood where everybody was feeling comfy and fun. The hostel have aproximatly 50/55 guests on avarage and in every activity usually half of the guests were joining.

About the dinner shift, it was on us to do the grocery, with a maximum budget of 25 euro, to cook a vegetarian meal for 30 people. This shift was probably one of the more stressful, but all of the staff always maanged to cook nice an accreaciated dinner; I aslo tried and learned lot of recepies from all around the globe ;)

Working at Onefam gave me to possibility to meet and chat with a looooot of poeple from all around the world.

It was amazing experience, full of emotion, great connection and self improving ;)

It for sure changed my perception of what life can give you and how poeple can be brave to find their own possibility.

The activity leader shift was one funnier but was challenging from time to time. It was on us to lead 20 or more young people, sometimes drunk people, around the city, and at the same time read the room and create the best experience for the all group.

This was so mush easier to manage with the help of all the friends from the staff ;) We were helping each other a lot making the days stressless for everyone.
